#Java-Mooks
##*"Alright, listen up ya mooks!"*

This is a personal repository for my programming for college. Nothing fancy yet, just small assignments.
Yes, it's in Java :( getting back to it is rough. It's not warm. It's like a load of pointy rocks.


Anyway, the point of this is to store my files for college for need of backup, and commit developments.
It is also to help out my fellow classmates with their assignments. The code is easy, but its been 2 years guys,
we're all in the same boat. Hopefully you can learn from my ~~mistakes~~ examples.


Here's the rub: you can use this repo to *help* you with your work. Learn from my code. Change it. Don't just copy/paste - thats for
your own sake. I bet, if we work together, we can out-perform this module, quickly.


*We shouldn't have to all make the same dumb mistakes.*


Now that I've told you **not** to *copy my work*, feel free to browse and learn.

*(Now you owe me)*

##Contribution
If you are one of my classmates, speak to me and make a github account. Another contributor would really help. Think of the good
we could do. Think of the learning we would undertake.

Seriously. If you can/want, please contribute.
